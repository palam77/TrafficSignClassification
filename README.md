# Traffic Sign Classification with CBAM-Enhanced CNN  

Welcome to the **Traffic Sign Classification Project**, a project designed to tackle the critical task of accurate traffic sign recognition. Leveraging a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) integrated with a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), this project demonstrates innovative advancements in computer vision and neural network architecture, with direct applications in autonomous driving systems and road safety technologies.

## Project Highlights  

- **Advanced Model Architecture:**  
  The final model incorporates CBAM layers, enhancing feature learning by focusing on channel-wise and spatially significant details.  
 
- **Real-World Application:**  
  Tested on a dataset of over 10,000 traffic sign images, the model generalizes across diverse regions and conditions, achieving a validation accuracy of **98.18%** and a test accuracy of **95.38%**.

- **Baseline Comparison:**  
  A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model serves as a baseline, providing insights into the effectiveness of the CNN architecture. 

- **Robust Evaluation:**  
  Tested on unseen datasets, including edge cases like blurry, low-light, and cropped images, to evaluate real-world applicability and limitations.

- **Ethical Considerations:**  
  The project ensures responsible AI deployment by addressing biases in training data and acknowledging privacy concerns during data collection.
